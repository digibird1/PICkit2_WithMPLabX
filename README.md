# PICkit2_WithMPLabX
Testing the PIC16F690 microcontroler of the PICkit2 with the MPLabX IDE from MicroChip. UART communication, ADC read and digital write was implementd on this evaluation board. The Project was mainly to test the IDE which runs now on Linux compared to the old MPLab, and to test programming the PIC in C-language with XC.
